## 🧠 React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled by default because of its performance impact.  
To enable it, see [this guide](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## ✅ ESLint & TypeScript

If you plan to develop this as a production app, we recommend adding TypeScript for type-safe development.  
Check out [the Vite TypeScript React template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
